## [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

The book is all about the Neural Networks and Deep Learning aspect of AI. The book is good for getting started with these. It consists some hands-on experience with the Neural Networks(implementation of handwriting recognition with NNs') and using deep learning improving the efficiency of it.

## [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - Book](http://people.inf.elte.hu/lorincz/Files/RL_2006/SuttonBook.pdf)

This is one of the must read text books for Reinforcement Learning which starts with basics on why reinforcement learning is needed and then dives into various methods and algorithms involved. It goes through various developments that have happened so far in RL. A new version is in [progress](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf).

## [RL Course by David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLzuuYNsE1EZAXYR4FJ75jcJseBmo4KQ9-)

David Silver is the leading scientist behind AlphaGo, DeepMind and Professor at Oxford. These are one of the few best available resources on internet to learn about reinforcement learning and cover also the latest research happening in the field.
